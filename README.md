# Typescript ROP

Code written for a tech-talk I'm giving at work about railway-oriented 
programming. The audience is TypeScript developers.

Code includes crude implementations of:

- `Result<T, E>`
- `Option<T>`
- A `boolean` wrapper with Rust-like methods that chain into Option/Result well.

NOT intended for production code.
